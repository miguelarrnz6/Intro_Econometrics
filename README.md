Introduction to Econometrics with R.

This is a collection of materials I use for my undergraduate course
on Econometrics. I will be using R and borrow the examples
from Stock&Watson's 'Introduction to Econometrics' (the recommended
textbook for the course) as well as Wooldridge's 'Introductory 
Econometrics'
